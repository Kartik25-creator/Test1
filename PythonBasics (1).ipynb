        "##### #Ans.Python is a high-level,interpreted programming language known for its readability,simplicity and versatility.It was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991.It is popular due to many reasons like python's simple and clean syntax makes it one of the most accessible programming languages for beginners.Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to a vast collection of third-party libraries, frameworks, and tools. This makes it easy to find solutions to problems and get support.It is used in diverse fields such as web development, scientific research, artificial intelligence, automation, finance, and more. This makes it highly versatile and in-demand across industries.\n",

This immutability makes tuples more efficient and safer to use in scenarios requiring constant data, like as dictionary keys or set elements.\n",
